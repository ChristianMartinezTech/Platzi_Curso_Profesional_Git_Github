# Platzi_Curso_Profesional_Git_Github

This is the folder to practice with the Git/Github Platzi [course](https://platzi.com/clases/git-github/)

# Notes
## Basic
* git branch [branch_name] to create a branch
* git checkout [branch_name] to move to said branch
* Git log show the whole commit history

## Advanced
* Git reset [logID] --hard (or soft)
* Git fetch retrieves the last meta-data from the original repo. **Doesn’t** do any file transferring. It’s more like just *checking to see if there are any changes available*.
